## Introduction
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to solve the communication gap between those who don't know sign language. The aim is to translate sign language into text to speech.

## Features
- Hand Sign Recognition (ASL)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
